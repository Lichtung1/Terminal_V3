Journal Entry - 03/15/1985:
Today, I successfully implemented the initial phase of the compression algorithm. The projection onto higher-dimensional topology shows promising results, with compression ratios exceeding expectations. However, encountered minor anomalies during data decoherence tests. Need to investigate further.

Journal Entry - 03/16/1985:
Continued testing with larger datasets. Noticed a consistent pattern in quantum state fluctuations. Speculating a connection with topological defects in the higher-dimensional structures. Will review literature on Jacob Bekenstein's entropy bounds.

Journal Entry - 03/17/1985:
Met with Dr. Bekenstein to discuss theoretical frameworks, and he provided valuable insights into entropy limitations. Planned to incorporate his feedback into the compression algorithm.
